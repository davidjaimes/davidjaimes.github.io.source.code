    	<b>Kepler-16b</b> (formally <b>Kepler-16 (AB)-b</b>) is an extrasolar planet. It is a Saturn-mass planet consisting of half gas and half rock and ice, and it orbits a binary star, Kepler-16, with a period of 229 days. "It is the first confirmed, unambiguous example of a circumbinary planet – a planet orbiting not one, but two stars," said Josh Carter of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, one of the discovery team.

    	<b>KOI-3570</b> (aliases: <b>2MASS J19405783+4009273</b>, <b>KIC 5023948</b>, and <b>WISE J194057.82+400927.3</b>) is an eclipsing binary star system. The term KOI means exactly what the name implies – Kepler has declared these to be "objects of interest," not planetary candidates. KOI-3570 is a member of the old open cluster NGC 6819. <b>NGC 6819</b> is an open cluster (commonly known as an "open star cluster") located 7,200 light years away in the Cygnus constellation. It was discovered by Caroline Herschel on 12 May 1784.
